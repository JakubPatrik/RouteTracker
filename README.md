# RouteTracker

A new Flutter App to track user's movement.

## Getting Started

This student project is a starting point of my Flutter Development ever.

A few resources I've used were 
- VisionStudio to template the design of the app.
- Android Studio to code the whole project 
- remote server to handle user's authentication
- Google Maps API to draw routes and track user's position over time
